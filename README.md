# Forge

A focused, private strength-training tracker for iPhone, built in SwiftUI. Forge is
meant to feel like a well-made tool: quick to operate between sets, calm to look at,
and careful with your data.

## What Forge is for

Forge tracks weightlifting workouts and nothing else. It is built around a few priorities:

- Fast to operate during a workout, including one-handed and while tired.
- Private by default. Workout data stays on the device.
- Reliable when interrupted by a call, the screen locking, or the app being closed.
- Native to iOS, using standard controls and behaviour.

There are no accounts, no ads, and no tracking. It is not a social network, a coach,
or a subscription.

## Features

- Log a workout as a scroll of exercise cards, each with its set table inline
  (previous result, weight, reps), so logging never leaves the screen.
- Rest timer with a configurable alert sound and haptic, and a Lock Screen notification.
- Routines and plans to start a workout from a template, with drag-to-reorder exercises.
- History with each exercise's previous sessions, a date-range filter, and workout detail.
- Next-session targets that pre-fill the weight the next time you do an exercise.
- Set types (drop set, failure), plus per-set and per-exercise notes.
- Optional personal-record markers and RPE, both off by default.
- Light, dark, or system appearance.
- Custom exercises, backup, and export (JSON and a full database file).
- Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels, and Reduce Motion support.

## Privacy

Forge stores workouts locally. It requires no account, includes no analytics or
advertising SDKs, and sends nothing off the device unless you deliberately export it.

## Installing

Forge is not on the App Store. You sideload the `.ipa` and sign it with your own free
Apple ID. This costs nothing, but a free Apple ID signature lasts seven days, so the tool
re-signs the app for you. You need an iPhone, a free Apple ID, and a computer. Get the
`.ipa` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/rodrigomaia06/Forge/releases) or a CI
build artifact.

First, on the iPhone, turn on Developer Mode: Settings, Privacy & Security, Developer Mode.
iOS 16 and later require it for sideloaded apps.

### Install with iLoader

[iLoader](https://iloader.app) runs the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

1. Install iLoader and connect the iPhone. On Linux, install `usbmuxd` first if it is not
   already present.
2. Open iLoader and sign in with your Apple ID.
3. Import the Forge `.ipa` and install it to the phone. iLoader signs it with your Apple ID.

### Notes

- A free Apple ID allows three sideloaded apps at once and re-signs every seven days. If a
  refresh is missed the app stops opening until it is signed again. Your data is kept.
- The paid Apple Developer Program (99 USD per year) is only needed for TestFlight or the
  App Store, not for sideloading.

## Development process

Forge is developed with AI-assisted tooling under human direction and review. Changes are checked in CI
and reviewed for behavior, data safety, accessibility, and design before release.

## Building

Building needs a Mac with Xcode. Without one, fork the repository and let its CI build the
app for you on a macOS runner. Both are covered in [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).

Project decisions and maintenance rules are documented in the [Forge documentation handbook](docs/README.md).
